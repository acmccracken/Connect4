# Connect4
* I made a version of the retro game, connect 4.  A fun 2 player game where opponents can test their cunning as they try to outsmart each other.  Choose your color, and the fun begins.  Follow the light up arrows to drop your piece.  Win, loose, or draw and you can play again.

### Technologies Used
* I used html, and css to present and style my game in a web browser, and Javascript to add functionality and game mechanics.

### Game On
* In honor of one of my favorite games, I invite you to play [Connect 4](https://acmccracken.github.io/Connect4/).  You and a friend can relive the fantastic childhood gaming experience of this timeless classic.  Select your piece to begin.

### Future Features
* I would like to add audio to capture the click clack of a game peice dropping, and to add full immersion, a sound effect for the clearing of the board.
* For when all of your friends get tired of losing, I would like to implement AI to provide a challenging 2 player experience for the serious solo gamer.
